This is my personal learning thing.
This project contains 4 modules, and it demonstrates CQRS & Event Sourcing design pattern.

The command query responsibility segregation (CQRS) pattern separates the data mutation, or the command part of a system, from the query part. 
You can use the CQRS pattern to separate updates and queries if they have different requirements for throughput, latency, or consistency.
